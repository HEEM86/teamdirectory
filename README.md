## Challenges :loudspeaker:


1. Wasn't able to get the remove employee selection, I believe the problem is with the query selector syntax using "DELETE" did some trial an error couldn't quite get it. [Remove Employee Challenge](https://youtu.be/aFW3423M9ps)


Snapshot of what I get in the terminal

![DeleteError](./images/deleteError.png)

2. The view manager selection gave me an issue, because the manager had a FOREIGNKEY because the manager is an employee but not group with the other employees.

3. After selecting "View Departments" the departments display, it doesn't loop back to the questions? I tried using a setTime to call the function, right after the view departments code.
